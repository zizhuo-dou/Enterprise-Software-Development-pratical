# App_Details
Team4 App for assessment in ESD
Source data: provided Excel file â€” reformatted into structured .txt files per country for easier ingestion and data cleaning during development. 
This app is meant to display pollution levels as compared to populations. This is an extremely simple app that the user can use to showcase the changes of each displayed country throughout the years. We were given data over only a few years and chose to display specific countries in that we only had a few weeks to get it done. The majority of the logic is contained in the views.py for the app. 

On page 15/18 of our project proposal, it states we would be using Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL for our backend components. However, in practice
we have decided that for a django app, Express would be redundant and Node.js not particularly necessary. We have decided to use PostgreSQL only to deal with our backend. Further, the project proposal states we would be using Redis but due to the shift form excel form/data caching to txt files, it is no longer necessary for the app. If the app chances where we will need to use data caching then Redis can be added but for now, the app does not need it.
